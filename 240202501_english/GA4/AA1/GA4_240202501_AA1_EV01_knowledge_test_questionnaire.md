# READING COMPREHENSION  

Julian lived in India for six months. Read about his experience.  

When I was 21, I had the chance to take part in a student exchange program at my university. I could have gone to Italy, France or any other western country. However, I wanted to try a more exotic culture. Therefore, I went to India and lived with a family for six months in the city of Jaipur. By that time, I had already read a lot about Indian culture and traditions, so I thought I was going to fit in well. Yet, when I arrived, I found out I was wrong. There were many things I felt shocked about.  

Some Indians don’t use utensils to eat their meals. Instead, they use their bare hands. They considered they connect with God by doing it. Although I had read about this previously, I really felt uncomfortable the first few times I had to eat with my hands. I felt as if my hands were dirty all the time. Jan, who was the oldest brother in my host family, told me that Indians eat with their hands because it is a way to have a spiritual connection with their God. Another thing that was difficult for me about food is the fact that I could not eat my favorite food in India. Pork is considered to be dirty food for Indians, so you do not find it anywhere.  

Another aspect that was shocking for me was that some toilets in India are a lot different. They are just a hole in the floor where you have to crouch and stand still while you use the bathroom. Also, it is common to use water in the bathroom as well as toilet paper to clean yourself. This is because Indians consider that using toilet tissue is not enough.  

Also, if you visit a house or temple in India, you have to take your shoes off. Indians consider their houses like temples, so they don’t want the dirt from the outside in their temple.  

Something that I found fascinating was its rich linguistic culture. There are more than 20 official languages in the country and 400 non-official languages. Although English is widely spoken across the country, in some towns they only speak the local language, making it difficult for you to communicate if you only speak English.  

These are some of the things I learned while in India which taught me that it is definitely not the same to read about a country’s culture as to go and experience the culture yourself. Going somewhere certainly will let you enjoy the experience a lot more.  

Although my days in India were unpleasant at the beginning because I was adjusting to the culture, I managed to get used to their culture and learned a lot from it. I certainly enjoyed my experience there. If I had the chance to choose again I would go to India without any doubt.
